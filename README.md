### What I learned
Thank you a lot fronted-mentor. This would be a basic and necessary challenge for me to practice and as well help me acknowledge some basic structures I have learnt before. Overview, I have known to set up a layout before coding. Additionally, I can use devtool in Chrome such as a view for me to apply any code from the file and can see them imediately. I rarely use display: grid, just block and flex but when it comes to this challenge, I just found it and gratefully use as well learn it.
